# Rust Project Creator

This is a small project to help me make rust projects using the cargo cli, this tool simply combines a few things into one simple and easy to use command.

### What it does:

1. Creates the directory for the new project
2. Initialized a rust project using cargo new
3. Adds a custom README.md file containing basic project info and commands used for development with cargo
4. Opens the project in Visual studio code (assuming its installed and set in the system path)

### Usage is simple

Once built you can run it in command prompt and parse 2 arguments: the file path for your project, the name of your project

```bash
RustProjectCreator C:\\Projects\\New HelloWorld
```

This is my first "major" project using rust and so its nothing crazy and I expect to improve this in the future
